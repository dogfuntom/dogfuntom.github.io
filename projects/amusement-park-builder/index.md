A prototype of an isometric 2D game that combines two genres:

- amusement park tycoon (similar to a city builder genre)
- clicker/incremental (sometimes known as idler)

We intentionally didn't have much of plan. The idea was to build a prototype with only “unavoidable” game mechanics of said genres. Namely, placing buildings and roads, and tapping on buildings to get money.

Initially the area is full of grass tiles. The player builds walkway tiles by tapping and/or dragging (sprites are replaced with dead-end/line/T-shape/X-shape automatically). Then attractions and stalls can be placed on tiles adjacent to walkways as long as they are all walkable between each other and the exit. (If an already existing building loses this connectivity, it turns red and stop functioning until rejoined or demolished.)

Then we prototyped further by trying multiple ideas, hoping to stumble upon unique and fun ideas for game mechanics, economics, or the rest of game design. However, no matter what we tried, we didn't manage to “find the fun” in this idea, so the project was canceled in favor of developing 2048 genre games instead.
