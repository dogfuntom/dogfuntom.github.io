Internal React tool for UnderÂ Armour
to plan the placement of clothes on hangers and shelves.
It helps employees of specific stores quickly understand
the desired arrangement of products visually.

## my contribution

Implementing the component responsible for the 3D scene.

Its input:

- store models, coordinates for placing items at them
- models of items to be placed
- a list of coordinate-model pairs indicating the placements

And the output is:

-   a scene with models in their designated positions, simple lighting,
    and camera rotation capability
-   clicking on a clothing model in the scene displays information
    about the item in the surrounding UI
