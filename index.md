This website contains postmortem-like descriptions of projects that I participated in development of.

Currently I wrote only one full postmortem-like post in English:

- [LOCO Railroad simulator | Unity, HDRP, custom physics](loco)

*[PCG]: Procedural Content Generation
*[SDF]: Signed Distance Function or Field (in this project a mixture of both is used)
*[ERC20]: A standard for a smart contract implementing fungible token (note the term "fungible" as opposed to the more well-known "non-fungible")
*[VSIX]: At the moment, the recommended and most popular format of Visual Studio extensions.

And here are a few of Russian-only short posts:

- [[Russian] Pebble generator](ru/pebbles) | Unity, URP, ShaderGraph, runtime PCG, SDF, Unity as a Library (React Native)
- [[Russian] Newsroom](ru/newsroom) | Unreal Engine, MetaHuman, Movie Render Queue in Runtime, Building UE from Source, C++, Blueprint
- [[Russian] Virtual product placement](ru/product-placement) | Babylon.js, React.js

Of course, I intend to translate these to English in the future.
For now, please use [Yandex's](https://translate.yandex.com/translate) or [Google's](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=websites) website translation features.
