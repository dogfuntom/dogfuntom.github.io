# Maxim Kamalov’s portfolio

I'm a Unity programmer and a web programmer.
And a bit of a technical artist – specifically, shaders, Blender, etc.
Furthermore, I have some experience with
C# – outside of Unity I mean – and XAML;
Unreal Engine – including editing its C++ source;
smart contracts; backends; PostgreSQL.
So far my career is exclusively freelance/part-time/remote.

One of my hobbies a.t.m. is tinkering with:
PowerShell,
hardware repair,
system administration,
Visual Studio extensibility,
accessibility in web,
buildless web,
procedural generation.

I like knowing about and/or using
algorithms (and data structures),
tooling & git,
math,
fonts & typography.

I like
knowledge & erudition;
written English & eloquence;
rationality & analysis;
laconic design;
flora & fauna – e.g. iNaturalist;
healthy food;
looking at concept art, sketches, impressionism, etc.;
Internet privacy;
history of art, architecture, food and everyday mundanity.
